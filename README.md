# Generative-Adversarial-Network
ğŸš€ Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is a deep learning architecture where two neural networks â€” the Generator and the Discriminator â€” compete against each other in a zero-sum game. The Generator creates realistic synthetic data, while the Discriminator tries to distinguish between real and generated data.
