🎨 GENERATIVE ADVERSARIAL NETWORK (GAN) FOR IMAGE GENERATION

A **Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)** is a deep learning model composed of two neural networks — a **Generator** and a **Discriminator** — that compete with each other in a game-theoretic setup. The Generator learns to produce realistic synthetic data, while the Discriminator attempts to distinguish between real and fake data.

This project demonstrates a basic implementation of GAN for generating synthetic images from random noise. It serves as a foundational entry point for understanding and experimenting with adversarial learning techniques.
